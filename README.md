# Notes and Exercies from Python Workout by Reuven Lerner

## Ch 1 Numeric Types

### Exercise 1 - Number guessing game
- Use `randint` in the `random` module to generate a random number
- Make an infinite loop with `while True:`
- Use `input` to get input from a user
- Use `int` to change a string to an integer

### Exercise 2 - Summing numbers
- Usee the "splat" operator (aka *) to allow a function to receive any number of arguments
- If you have an iterable object and want to pass its elements to a function, just preface it with * in the function call

### Exercise 3 - Run timing
- Empty string and the numeric 0 are considered to be `False`
- Use `not` in front of a variable that might be empty to evaluate `False`
- Wrap user input in `try` in case the user gives you an illegal value

### Excercise 4 - Hexadecimal Output
- `enumerate` returns a two-element tuple with each iteration. This provides the numeric index of each iteration.
- `reversed` returns a new iterable
- `**` operator is used for exponentiation
